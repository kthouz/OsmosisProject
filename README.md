# OsmosisProject
This includes scripts used to analyze image generated during osmosis experiment.
Osmosis class contains parameters and properties of each experiment as well as methods to analyze recorded images

## osmosis.py
Use osmosis to measure the change in size of each drop. The user will 
1. Provide all input variables. The code will display the reference frame from the provided directory. 
2. Select a rectangular region of interest bounding the drop of interest. The code will crop that region and allow you to select two other regions of interest
3. Select two regions of interest bounding the left and right edge of the drop. The code will then loop through all of the images, tracking that particular drop and measuring its size. At the end, csv tables of edges positions, volumes and concentrations will be generated in the same directory you provided before

##Plotgenerator.py
This script reads files generated by osmosis.py and plots summarizing charts. The user is only required to provide the directory from which to
